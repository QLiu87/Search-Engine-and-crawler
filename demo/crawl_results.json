UCI humanists study culture, language, history and creative expression around the globe. We teach fourteen languages, have expertise in international and diasporic cultures and identities, and bring communities together through our many cultural centers and programs. From archaeological and archival study to digital and globally networked scholarship, UCI opens new perspectives on the human world in all its depth and breadth. Through literary and media analysis, translation, documentary practice and storytelling, humanists at UCI investigate the ways human beings have symbolized their experiences and shared them with others. Examining ancient stone inscriptions and classic orators to texts, mainstream films and social media, humanists at UCI help us understand the voices of the past, present and future. We encourage scholars and creative practitioners\u2014such as novelists, poets, journalists, filmmakers, and digital media producers\u2014to learn from one another. The UCI School of Humanities leads these fields, offering the nation's only undergraduate major in literary journalism, one of the few Ph.D. programs in visual studies in the nation, and the internationally recognized International Center for Writing and Translation. Humanists at UCI explore and challenge what humans think and know. Philosophy and theory help us ask questions about ourselves, what we take for granted, and the distinctions between truth, falsity and error. Philosophical and theoretical inquiry reach across disciplines to pose challenging questions to law, medicine, technology, race, sexuality, the environment, and digital information. Humanists at UCI lead these fields with a #1 ranking in literary criticism and theory and #9 ranking in epistemology, the study of knowledge and its limits. Humanists at UCI illuminate the human dimensions of science, technology and the environment. We examine the changes that the sciences and technology have brought to our species, including the ways we have imagined and represented these changes through philosophy, literature, and visual art. We apply humanistic perspectives and methods to the grand challenges of our time\u2014from the mysteries of the brain, to the ethical dilemmas of biomedicine and biotechnologies, to the human elements of climate change and artificial and virtual worlds.

And during this era of pandemic misinformation, these virtues can help decipher the truth. How does society benefit when we nurture these intellectual virtues? And how does UCI\u2019s Anteater Virtues Project help students thrive, no matter what they\u2019re studying?From the University of California, Irvine, I\u2019m Aaron Orlowski. And you\u2019re listening to the UCI Podcast.Today, I\u2019m speaking with Duncan Pritchard, who is a distinguished professor of philosophy at UCI and the director of the Center for Knowledge, Technology and Society. He\u2019s also the director of the Anteater Virtues Project.Professor Pritchard, thank you for joining me today on the UCI Podcast.DUNCAN PRITCHARDGreat to be here. Thanks for having me.ORLOWSKISo you\u2019ve created this online course, the Anteater Virtues Project for UCI students, and it focuses on four core intellectual virtues \u2014 curiosity, integrity, intellectual humility and intellectual tenacity. But the value of these virtues extends beyond students. So for people who are not in college or they already graduated college, why is it worth it to try and study and internalize these virtues?PRITCHARDSo the idea is that they\u2019re practically useful. So they\u2019re the most transferable skills that you could ever hope to have, whatever problems or challenges you face in your life, whatever subject matters you\u2019re studying, or subject matter you\u2019re engaging with at work \u2014 these things will be practically useful. But the thought is that they\u2019re more than just practically useful. They\u2019re useful for their own sake. They\u2019re good things to have for living a good life. And what we\u2019re trying to do at UCI is focus specifically on the intellectual virtues, because we think that they\u2019re the ones that are most essentially tied to learning.ORLOWSKIThese virtues are essentially part of learning not just what to think, but how to think.PRITCHARDYeah, absolutely. That\u2019s really key. We increasingly have quite a narrow view of education, where we\u2019re just sort of teaching people a very quite specific set of facts and expertise, very subject-matter-orientated. And obviously there\u2019s a place for that. If you want to learn engineering, there are lots of things which are specific to engineering you need to learn in order to be an engineer. And if you want to learn biology, there are lots of things specific to biology that you need to learn. But there are certain kinds of general learning strategies that you really have to internalize if you\u2019re going to be the person who will flourish intellectually. And that\u2019s what the intellectual virtues are about. They\u2019re not specific to any subject matter. Although, as it happens, philosophers, we\u2019ve ended up being the ones pushing the case for them. But lots of people, lots of different walks of life \u2014 educational theorists and psychologists, and so on \u2014 lots of people see the merit of these traits, a special value. And there value precisely lies in the fact that they\u2019re not narrow, they\u2019re not specific to any particular task or subject matter or anything like that. They\u2019re entirely general intellectual traits.ORLOWSKILet\u2019s break these down a little bit and look at the four of them in a bit more detail, starting with curiosity. What does that mean? And how do we apply that to our daily lives?PRITCHARDWe chose all four because we thought they were core to a university intellectual mission. And curiosity is probably the most obvious one on that list, in that regard, because any kind of intellectual endeavor, you need to have curiosity. And we\u2019re thinking of curiosity as a virtue is more than just, for example, asking questions or something like that. It\u2019s a certain kind of character trait where you\u2019re asking the right questions in the right kind of way. This is one thing that we cover in the course. All the virtues, and the intellectual virtues are no different, they lie between two vices: a vice of excess and a vice of deficiency. So a vice of not having enough of it and a vice of having too much of it. And curiosity is the same as that. So you can be overly curious, you can ask questions which are irrelevant. You can ask pointless questions, and so on. And you can also have the vice of deficiency, where you\u2019re just not curious at all. And part of what it is to master the virtue of curiosity is to have that drive to find things out, but to have it in a proportionate way and to be responsive to the things that you need to be responsive to in order to reach your intellectual goals. This is what\u2019s called the golden mean. It\u2019s navigating a way between these two vices. And that\u2019s how you master a virtue.ORLOWSKISo what about integrity? Is it possible to have too much of that?PRITCHARDYou know, that\u2019s a really interesting question. So some people worry that something like integrity isn\u2019t quite a virtue for that reason, because virtues lie between two vices. But I think to think like that is to equate integrity \u2014 which is quite a sophisticated trait, I think \u2014 with something a bit more pedestrian, something like honesty. Probably can\u2019t have too much of honesty, if honestly just means saying the truth, anyway. But integrity is more sophisticated than that. I think it\u2019s a trait about how you treat others, about how you treat ideas. I\u2019ll give you an example. We live in very much a social media, a Twitter age. And I think one of the things you see there a lot when people engage with one another, they don\u2019t engage with each other in good faith. They misrepresent other people, knowingly misrepresent them. They try to twist their words. They try to take their words out of context and so on. And I think part of what it is to have intellectual integrity is not to do that. It\u2019s kind of like a duty to yourself, right? So it\u2019s a kind of honesty, but it\u2019s also a kind of honest and open dealings with others.The traits that underlie that you can have them to excess. You could be pedantic, nitpicking, and so on. That wouldn\u2019t be a sign of having excessive amounts of integrity, it would just be a sign you\u2019ve got the vice of excess here. The virtue is sort of being proportionate in this, not just drilling down on details for their own sake, not being nitpicking for their own sake, pedantic, but trying to be charitable. So on the one hand, don\u2019t misrepresent people, but don\u2019t try to represent people in an authentic way to the extent where in a sense you\u2019re also misrepresenting them. And I think that\u2019s where integrity lies.So I think this is quite important the way we teach it. It isn\u2019t just about you. So one way to think about integrity is just a kind of honesty, or something just about your own dealings with it, your attitude to yourself. But it\u2019s also, I think, important to think about other people and how you deal with them in an intellectual way, how you have respect for others, respect for their opinions, dealing with people, charitably, and so on, trying to understand where they\u2019re coming from, understand their reasons, and so on. We treat all of those things as being part of what it is to have intellectual integrity. Of course, in a university context, we also tie this into issues about academic misconduct and plagiarism and so on because there\u2019s a practical side to this. One has to learn what it is to avoid plagiarism and so on when you\u2019re a student. But we try to build that into a broader moral about what is it to have integrity.ORLOWSKIWell, and what about intellectual humility? What does that mean in this context?PRITCHARDWe\u2019ve picked humility, intellectual humility and intellectual tenacity, together because we think they make an interesting pairing. Intellectual humility, I think, is often misunderstood. I think a lot of people might think of humility as a kind of downgrading of oneself. It\u2019s like a lack of intellectual self-esteem or something like that. That\u2019s not how we\u2019re thinking of it. As a virtue, intellectual humility is very much related to these traits I just mentioned with integrity and that\u2019s not an accident. All the intellectual virtues that are interrelated.To be intellectually humble is to be aware of one\u2019s limitations, intellectual limitations, and therefore not to be dogmatic or overestimate one\u2019s abilities. But it\u2019s also to have an openness to others in one\u2019s dealings with others. So receptiveness to other people\u2019s ideas, not just to be dismissive of them. And I think it reveals itself in a lack of intellectual arrogance. Arrogant people don\u2019t listen to others. Sometimes even if you know more about something than someone else, there\u2019s something to be said for having respect for their opinions and listening carefully to them and engaging with them, and not being haughty about it, even if you know that you do know more about this. And I think this is intellectual humility on display. What it reveals is a love for the truth, a care and concern for the truth, and thereby a care and concern for reasons, and for other people and other people and their reasons \u2014 other people as intellectual subjects.We paired this with tenacity because I think a lot of people might think antecedently that humility and tenacity are sort of in tension with one another. So tenacity is about having a kind of grit, conviction and so forth, seeing things through. And I think it\u2019s tempting to think that to be humble is to lack conviction. And conversely, to have conviction, to have grit, is not to be humble. One of the things we try to do is show how actually these two things go together. You can have conviction and follow through on your opinions and so forth, whilst at the same time, respecting the opinions of others. Respecting other people\u2019s opinions, listening to others, having an intellectual care for others, is not the same thing as giving up your own opinions. And I think that\u2019s very important. I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s actually gotten lost in the sort of social media age, where it\u2019s often seen that the mere fact that you\u2019re listening to someone engaging with someone is seen as a kind of abnegation of your convictions. So that\u2019s why we paired them. We think, especially in intellectual contexts, it\u2019s important for people to see how these two virtues can co-exist with one another.ORLOWSKIWell, it seems like a lot of these essentially compel a person to slow down and consider both their own reasons for believing something and the reasons someone else might believe in something. And these are things that we could really use in society at large, to help us overcome some of the more challenging situations that we face today, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, which we\u2019re more than a year into it and, and folks are getting vaccinated. But there\u2019s still a lot of misinformation about both the COVID-19 pandemic and about vaccines themselves. So what do you think these virtues could do to help us overcome and sort of finally beat this pandemic?PRITCHARDI think they\u2019re certainly necessary for dealing with misinformation in the information age. This is one of the problems we face in contemporary society that we\u2019re susceptible to groupthink, we\u2019re susceptible to silos of thought, and so forth, where people aren\u2019t listening to one another, people are arguing past one another. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t really matter that much, not a lot hangs on these things. But other times things of great consequence hang on it. And I think when it comes to issues like vaccine takeup, and masks during a pandemic, and so forth, misinformation can become quite dangerous.And you need the virtues to navigate this environment. I mean, that\u2019s how you as an individual deals with it. I think we also need structural solutions to these problems. But you as an individual, it helps you to deal with it because as you say, it helps you to slow down. It helps you to reflect. It creates habits of thought. I mean, that\u2019s essentially what the virtues are. They\u2019re character traits, which means that over time they become second nature. They\u2019re habitual ways of responding. And when they\u2019re working well, you don\u2019t even need to think about them. So you\u2019ll just find yourself reflecting on the evidence given, not just simply responding emotively to something someone said, or being swept up by the rhetoric, or what have you. But thinking more carefully about, well, what are the reasons for this? How does this relate to other things that I believe, and so forth?And also, for example, intellectual humility will kick in here. When one finds oneself having very strong convictions about things, to reflect on whether they\u2019re warranted. Obviously we\u2019re fallible creatures. We make mistakes. We\u2019re apt to be taken in by information that we read. It\u2019s important when you\u2019re dealing with misinformation to evaluate that information horizontally and not just vertically. So what that means is you not just verify it by going to the same source or similar sources to verify it, but by going outside the source and getting independent verification. It\u2019s very easy not to do that. Right. It\u2019s very easy, especially in a social media type context to get your verification by looking at the very same people who are telling you the original thing, so you\u2019re not really going outside the loop. To be intellectually virtuous is to be alert to those kinds of factors. And so I think for an individual level, it\u2019s one way of insulating yourself against the dangers of misinformation.ORLOWSKIWell, and so UCI students have the opportunity to dive really deeply into these virtues, through the Anteater Virtues Project. So tell us the backstory there, what prompted you to launch that project?PRITCHARDWell, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been interested in for a while. I mean, more than that, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how it\u2019s worked in educational projects, not at the university level, but in schools and in prisons actually. So one project I led back in Scotland was a running program for bringing the intellectual virtues into prison education. And it had massive effects. We were completely taken aback by the effectiveness of this program. In fact, Scottish prison education now is completely different as a result, it was so effective. Seeing how lives could be transformed by having a different sort of educational input into them. And similar things have happened in schools. Actually here in Long Beach, there are two schools which have been founded on intellectual virtue lines, and they\u2019re regarded as sort of cutting edge educational establishments.And it just struck me. I was amazed no one had tried to do this, given it\u2019s been so effective in schools and in other educational contexts, that it hadn\u2019t been done at a university level. So people have brought the virtues into university curricula, but the actual idea of just focusing on the intellectual virtues, that\u2019s what interested me, because it seemed to me that\u2019s where you get the biggest payoff. You could actually sort of bring that in right across the curriculum. So they\u2019re not just learning it within the humanities or within a philosophy degree or something like that, but whatever their major, whatever they come to study, that they\u2019ll get to engage with intellectual virtues and think more generally about what\u2019s an education for. And so that\u2019s what excited me. And that\u2019s what led to this project.ORLOWSKIIt sounds in some ways like a way to push back against the trend that we sometimes see of education focusing solely on specific career outcomes. Someone goes to college in order to get a diploma so that they can get a job and earn money. But getting an education is about more than that. And the school that you\u2019re in, the School of Humanities, focuses a lot on growing people as intellectuals. So why do you think it is important to have this balanced approach of learning how to think and learning about the humanities while also gaining these career skills?PRITCHARDYeah, I think it\u2019s absolutely crucial. To be fair, I think most educators, whatever their discipline, they understand this \u2014 that education isn\u2019t just about teaching your subject matter, but it\u2019s about developing the student as a person, developing their intellectual character. But it\u2019s a case of communicating that to the student. I think it\u2019s not always obvious to them that that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. I mean, they see courses on their transcript. They see grades. I think it\u2019s very natural to think, well, the education is just what I get in the classroom when I\u2019m doing the courses for my major or something like that. And I think this is where the arguments we have to make for the humanities really \u2014 they\u2019re very straightforward when you think about them. We need to see that really the humanities, although it is a division of the university, it is kind of at the heart of a university education. So what is it to develop someone intellectually, as a person \u2014 that\u2019s primarily, it seems to me, the concern of the humanities. So even if it occurs in all educational contexts, it seems that we\u2019re doing it in the most direct way.That\u2019s why, if you can take a project like this and embed it within the curriculum more generally, you can have a large impact. I mean, this is where I think I see what we\u2019re doing here. Actually, it\u2019s kind of making explicit what is really already implicit. The UCI education is about developing intellectual character. It\u2019s just, we don\u2019t cast it that way. We don\u2019t present it that way. And I think this project ought to be a way for students to see that \u2014 make it explicit to them. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Hopefully by making explicit to them, be more effective in that aim, they\u2019ll be more effective learning how to develop themselves intellectually because they\u2019re aware of what that means \u2014 that this is what an education is all about. So I think that\u2019s where the humanities fits in here. We need to think of humanities teaching, I think, not just the teaching that goes on in humanities courses, but as something which is at the heart of any good educational system at this level.ORLOWSKIAnd you\u2019ll be actually researching and testing to see how this Anteater Virtues Project affects students academically. So you\u2019ll be studying that. But what exactly will you be examining as you\u2019re looking at that?PRITCHARDWe did a pilot study last year before the COVID pandemic put everything on a hiatus, and we got some very good results there. What we\u2019re looking for is we want to see how students respond. And what you\u2019re looking for really is certain kinds of improvements and seeing how those improvements manifest across all the different demographics. I mean, one thing that\u2019s quite well known in studies of this kind is that any educational intervention will tend to have some positive effects. I mean, just by virtue of it being an educational intervention. But what you tend to find, those effects can be quite small, and you may find that it\u2019s just students who ordinarily do well, who disproportionately benefit from them. And students who generally don\u2019t do quite so well don\u2019t benefit.And one thing we were looking for and found in the pilot study is actually the results, they were quite significant, but also they were stable across all demographics. I mean, not just the demographics of whether it\u2019s male and female, or demographics academically in terms of their performance or in terms of whether there were underrepresented minorities, for example. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. Because we want to show this is effective and it\u2019s effective really for everyone. And that\u2019s what we found in the pilot. And we have a second study, a bigger study. We\u2019re taking more students. This one will have more of a focus on comparing STEM students with humanities students and seeing what the comparison is there. So we are quite excited about that. It\u2019ll be a much more extensive study.ORLOWSKIThat\u2019ll be exciting to see those results when they come out. So, but for someone who is not a college student, and they\u2019re not able to take this Anteater Virtues Course, but they really want to start embedding these virtues into their life more, how should they get started?PRITCHARDWell, it certainly helps if you know what they are, if you can identify them. That\u2019s obviously one thing that we do in this project, because I think they, as I said, with some of these virtues \u2014 integrity, humility and so on \u2014 they\u2019re a bit more nuanced than their titles might at first appear. But the general idea is a straightforward one. You need to be around virtuous people. And I think all of us are around such people. They may be teachers or family members or people in one\u2019s community. I think usually we can spot them. People who, if they have good character, they\u2019re good people to learn from. I mean, this is how, going right back to ancient Greece, Confucius said similar things: by being around people like that, one can learn to emulate them. Their virtues sort of rub off on you. I mean, by the same token, you have to not try to emulate people who clearly have the vices, even though some of those vices might be, in some respects, attractive traits, might be fun traits to have, for example. But one has to fight against the urge to emulate them.And it\u2019s not just people as well. I think one of the things you can learn from great works of literature, for example, even from films, I think, is getting to know certain kinds of characters in those, and seeing how a very sophisticated interplay of people and their development. You can learn a lot about what it is to be virtuous just by witnessing the character development in that way. I think it\u2019s better if it\u2019s actual real life people that you\u2019re engaging with. But I think that\u2019s one of the things literature can contribute to intellectual development because it can make vivid certain character traits, and make us see the value and see the disvalue of other kinds of character traits and so on.ORLOWSKISo don\u2019t forget the literature classes and other humanities courses from your high school, your college days. Bear those in the front of your mind.PRITCHARDAbsolutely. And in fact, this is one of the next phases for the Anteater Virtues. We\u2019re hoping to embed it in a transformative text type project. So we\u2019ve got our modules on the virtues, but we\u2019ll also have modules devoted to contemporary texts, quite a diverse range of authors as befitting, such a diverse campus that we are. So getting people through literature to think about some of these ideas.ORLOWSKIProfessor Pritchard, thank you so much for joining me today on the UCI Podcast.\u00a0PRITCHARDThanks for having me.
